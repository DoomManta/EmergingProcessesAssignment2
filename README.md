# gilded-rose-rafactoring-kata

This is an aexcercise adapted from https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.

We recorded a screen video with audio showing our MOB excercise. It eceeded the maximum size for a youtube video so it is hosted in my onedrvie account.

(the video cutout for some reason, i think we only partially captured the additional features part of the excercise but we did it as a team and as a MOB.)

Team Roster:

* Sourav Debnath
* Martin Perry
* Kristin Hegna
* Christopher Taylor
