# gilded-rose-refactoring-kata

This is an exercise adapted from https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.

We recorded a screen video with audio showing our MOB exercise. It exceeded the maximum size for a youtube video so it is hosted in Martin's onedrvie account.

(the video cutout for some reason, but covered the majority of the mob session.)

Team Roster:
